# Image Tag

In HTML, the <img> tag is used to embed images on a web page. Unlike other tags, the <img> tag is self-closing, meaning it doesn’t require a closing tag.

Important Attributes of the <img> Tag:
src: Specifies the source (URL) of the image.

Example: <img src="image.jpg" />

The src attribute can point to an image on the same server (relative URL) or an image on an external server (absolute URL).

alt: Provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed. This is important for accessibility and SEO.

Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery" />

width: Specifies the width of the image in pixels or as a percentage.

Example: <img src="image.jpg" width="500" />

height: Specifies the height of the image in pixels or as a percentage.

Example: <img src="image.jpg" height="300" />

title: Adds a tooltip to the image. The tooltip appears when the user hovers over the image.

Example: <img src="image.jpg" title="A beautiful scenery" />

loading: Specifies how the image should be loaded.

lazy: The image will be loaded only when it’s about to enter the viewport (for improved performance).

eager: The image will be loaded immediately.

Example: <img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" />
